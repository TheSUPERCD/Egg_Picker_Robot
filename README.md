# Egg_Picker_Robot
Project Robotic Arm was an amature project that I did in my 1st semester at IIT Palakkad along with my group of 5.

I was responsible for implementing the claw system in the robotic arm and the torque delivery system in the joints of the robot to grab and move objects.
We had to design a Robotic Arm to grab and move an egg from one table and place it on another table placed at 90 degrees w.r.t. the 1st table.


This project was done under Dr. Anuradha Shankar.
